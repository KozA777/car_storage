# Car Management System

## Overview

The **Car Management System** is an Angular-based web application that allows users to store and manage information about cars and their services in the browser's localStorage. Users can add cars to the system and record detailed information about each car's services, including parts and costs. The application provides an intuitive interface for viewing, updating, and deleting cars and their associated service details.

## Features

- **Add Cars**: Users can add cars to the system with details like name, model, and registration.
- **Store Service Information**: For each car, users can add services, including part names and costs, which are displayed in the car's details view.
- **View Cars**: All cars stored in the system are listed with their details and the option to view, edit, or delete them.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: All car and service data is stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage, ensuring persistence between sessions.
- **Delete Car**: Users can delete a car and all its associated service records with a confirmation dialog.
- **CSV Export**: Users can export the list of cars, including their service details, to a CSV file.
